## Usage
This project works with modules, so is necessary to run the `index.html` file with the live server.  
When the program starts, the page will show a container with two tables: one with all the weekly products, and the other only with the products that are not old, removed, or expired.  
The program uses some default configuration values (start date, days to wait, weeks, items per week, item week life and language) but these can be changed in the settings panel by the user, clicking on the button in the top right corner of the page. The save button is to click only when all the data is inserted correctly, otherwise the panel will show error messages and the program will restart. The reset button is to reset all the input data inserted and to clear all the error messages.  
On the sides of the container there are two arrows that are used to change the week.

---

## Configuration and technical characteristics
The configuration values that can be modified by the user are:
 - Start date: the date from which the program will start.
 - days to wait: the number of days to add to the starting date before which the program will start.
 - weeks: the number of weeks that the program will show;
 - items per week: the number of items that will be added every week;
 - item week life: the number of weeks after which the product becomes old;
 - language: the language used to display the dates (only italian and english are available).

Attention! The values inserted by the user in the settings panel are saved only if all the data is inserted and correctly. If the "save settings" button is clicked, the program will restart.

## Changelog and version history

For this project we used a mix of git version control and cloud backups via Google Drive. The git history is embedded in the project folder and be verified (note that some people may have less commits than others, this is due to the mixed usage of the two different tools, and is something that should be improved for future projects).
